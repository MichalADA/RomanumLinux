# RomanumLinux

**RomanumLinux** is an experimental Linux distribution built entirely from scratch, based on the Linux From Scratch (LFS) project.  
It is inspired by the elegance of Latin and the classical spirit of simplicity, structure, and clarity.

## 🌍 Project Vision

The idea behind RomanumLinux is to:

- Learn how Linux works at the lowest levels
- Build a fully functioning Linux system from scratch
- Add a custom layer of Latin-inspired aliases and user interface elements
- Experiment with language, culture, and operating system design
- Document the entire process step by step

## 📁 Repository Structure (planned)

- `LFS/` – All steps following the official LFS book, broken down by chapters
- `DOSC/` – Documentation of problems, ideas, fixes, and design decisions
- `system/` – Scripts, aliases, and configuration files of the custom system
- `latin/` – A custom layer of Latin terminology for commands and messages

## 📅 Timeline

This project is developed for learning and fun. The goal is not to replace any existing Linux distribution but to explore and share knowledge. Updates will be added regularly as the build progresses.

## 🧠 Requirements

To follow this project, you should:
- Be familiar with Linux basics
- Have a machine or VM to test with
- Be curious and patient

## 🏛️ Long-Term Goals

- Bootable ISO of RomanumLinux
- Custom shell with Latin aliases
- Optional system messages in Latin
- Website or wiki documenting everything
